- Hacking is getting unauthorized access to a system.
- Hackers generally are of three types:

  - Black Hat: Such hackers generally tend to cause some damage, steal information
  - White Hat: These hakers utilise the hacking knowledge for security/educational purposes
  - Grey Hat: These hackers intrude into systems but don't cause any damage to the sytem, nor steal information.

- Hacking actually do have a really big industry, due to large need of organizations to secure there data, and systems.

## Setup for learning

- For, this purpose we will utilise the concept of Virtual Machines, to replicate various systems.
- Let's discuss each component for this course:

  - Host Machine: This is your main PC or Laptop with it's current OS
  - Hacking Machine: [Kali Linux VM] This is the VM from where attack will be executed.
  - Target Machine: The Machines which we will be trying to hack into.

    - We will be using 2 target machines for this course.

      - Windows
      - Metasploitable

- What we are utilising here to have these VMs is called Virtualization. Virtualization allows you to create
